                <h1>Number Guessing</h1>
                <p>The Number Guessing Game is a fun and interactive game in which the computer randomly selects a number within 
                    a predefined range, and the player tries to guess it in the fewest attempts possible. <br> <br>

                   »  At the start of the game, the program generates a random number (for example, between 1 and 100).  <br>
                   
                   »  The player then enters their guess. <br>
                   
                   »  After each guess, the program provides a hint: <br>

                   »  If the guess is too high, it tells the player to try a smaller number. <br>
                   
                   »  If the guess is too low, it tells the player to try a larger number. <br>
                   
                   »  The process continues until the player correctly guesses the number or it use limited attempts. <br>
                   
                   »  The game can also keep track of the number of attempts taken to guess correctly, encouraging the player to improve. <br>
